# Python-Interactive-Crossword
A one-off snippet that lets you solve crossword puzzles from a Python console

## What is this?
This is a way to solve crosswords in Python. By you, the old-fashioned way, using the console. It's intended for killing time in boring situations, primarily. Channel your inner Stanley from *The Office*. (That's why I made it, I had an hour to kill and no access to my normal projects.)

## How do I use it? 
If you run it, you'll immediately get the chance to solve a "crossword"- it's really more of a test. This is what you'll see:
    From top to bottom and left to right
    1 over: wet
    1 down: transportation
    2 over: piracy's end
    2 down: seek a cure
    3 over: cheaper business
    3 down: faster than light
    4 down: protection, but long

     A  +  +  +  –  –     +  –  –  –  – 
     B  |  |  |           |             
     C  +  +  +           |             
     D  |     |           |             
     E  |     |           |             
     F  |     |           |             
     G  |     |                         
     H                                  
     I                                  
     J                                  
     K                                  
    Choose a square or type $CLUES for clues: 
  
To make your own crossword, you can edit the "cw_file.json", or remove that as a parameter from the Crossword definition and use a different file. I really didn't put enough effort into this to warrant any kind of documentation, you'll figure it out.
